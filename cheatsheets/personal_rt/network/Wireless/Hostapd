My next step was to install hostapd-wpe, one of my go to Enterprise RADIUS MiTM attack techniques. I was happy to see that Kali is now including this in the repos, making for an easy install instead of needing to patch hostapd yourself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
apt-get install hostapd-wpe

To configure hostapd-wpe, modify the configuration file:

nano /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf

so that:

ssid=<Targeted SSID>
channel=1
<insert new line under channel>
ieee80211n=1
<scroll down quite a bit and change>
hw_mode=g

With this configured, you can now launch hostapd-wpe:

./hostapd-wpe /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf
