# Single Host

./fimap.py -u "http://localhost/vulnerable.php?inc=index.php"  

# List of Hosts

./fimap.py -m -l "/tmp/myurllist.txt"  

# GOOGLE SCAN Same as mass scan. 
# But instead of getting the urls from a txt-list it will use google to get urls. To use google mode use:

./fimap.py -g -q 'inurl:"include.php"'  
./fimap.py -g -q 'inurl:"req.php" -svn -trak -cvs'
