# APKTool 
# In order to reverse an APK, do the following

java -jar apktool_2.1.1.jar d <apkname.apk>

# Keep in mind that the "d" option will decode the APK
# The resulting output will be a directory with the AndroidManifest.xml
# SOMETIMES THERE IS MORE THAN ONE ANDROIDMANIFEST.XML FILE SO DEBUGGING THE APK CAN MAKE IT EASIER 
# TO READ THE FINAL ANDROIDMANIFEST.XML FILE
