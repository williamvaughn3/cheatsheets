--------------------------------------

Commands I used, and work from ~ directory

ssh-keygen -t rsa

* You will be asked

Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): 
/root/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? y
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

*******When you are asked the above I just hit enter to get all defaults -- then I get the following output


Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:j2G4Ol5LoJR9bgy808TvXz8W56KVp/o/leF9uWcKl3c root@kali

***Now I enter

(echo -e "\n\n"; cat id_rsa.pub; echo -e "\n\n") > /root/Desktop/foo.txt  <--this will output 

the keygen to the desktop

to be continued
