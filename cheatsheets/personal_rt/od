# Example - will return with spaces
echo -n "Hello" | od -A n -t x1

# Example with SED - will delete all spaces

echo -n "Hello" | od -A n -t x1 | sed 's/ //g'

# To dump a file in octal format:
od <binary-file>
od -o <binary-file>
od -t o2 <binary-file>

# To dump a file in hexadecimal format:
od -x <binary-file>
od -t x2 <binary-file>

# To dump a file in hexadecimal format, with hexadecimal offsets and a space between each byte:
od -A x -t x1 <binary-file>

# Explanation:
## The echo program will provide the string to the next command.
## The -n flag tells echo to not generate a new line at the end of the "Hello".
## The od program is the "octal dump" program. (We will be provide a flag to tell it to dump it in hexadecimal instead of octal.)
## The -A n flag is short for --address-radix=n, with n being short for "none". Without this part, the command would output an ugly numerical address prefix on the left side. This is useful for large dumps, but for a short string it is unnecessary.
## The -t x1 flag is short for --format=x1, with the x being short for "hexidecimal" and the 1 meaning 1 byte.
