## Common dependencies

Always install the following

    apt install libvulkan1 libvulkan-dev vulkan-utils

## Instructions per GPU vendor

A general support matrix can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)#Compatibility

### Intel Graphics

Intel support starts with i3-/i5-/i7-3000 chipsets.

When using Intel this means using Mesa

    apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers

### Nvidia

Use this PPA

    add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
    apt update
    apt upgrade
    apt install vulkan

### AMD

Note: the "radeon" driver won't work with vulkan.

FIXME

## Verify setup

Running

    vulkaninfo

should print a lot of infos and not VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER

## Debuging performance

Run your wine setup with the following environment

    export DXVK_HUD=devinfo,fps
