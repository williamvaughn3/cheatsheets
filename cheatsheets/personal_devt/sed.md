## Command Syntax

    /abc/p      # Print all with "abc"
    /abc/!p     # Print all without "abc"
    /abc/d      # Delete all with "abc"
    /abc/!d     # Delete all without "abc"

    /start/,/end/!d        # Select a block

    s/abc/def/
    s/abc\(...\)ghi/\1/    # Back references 
                           # (see below for correct Shell quoting)

    /abc/{s/def/ghi)}      # Conditional replace

Appending lines

    aHallo                   # Append 'Hallo' after each line
    5 aHallo                 # Append 'Hallo' after line #5
    $ aHallo                 # Append 'Hallo' to end of file
    
    /abc/r<(printf "%s\n" "Hallo")     # Append 'Hallo' after pattern 'abc'
    
Prepending lines

    sed -i '1s;^;new line 1\nanother new line 2\n;' <file>

## Advanced use of sed

### In-place Editing

To edit file use the -i option this safely changes the file contents
without any output redirection needed.

    sed -i 's/abc/ABC/' myfile.txt
    sed -i '/deleteme/d' *

### Drop grep

Often grep and sed are used together. In all those cases grep can be
dropped. For example

    grep "pattern" file | sed "s/abc/def/"

can be written as

    sed -n "/pattern/p; s/abc/def/"

### Grouping with sed

Always use single quotes!

    sed 's/^.*\(pattern\).*/\1/'

### Single Quoting Single Quotes

If you want to do extraction and need a pattern based on single quotes
use \\x27 instead of trying to insert a single quote. For example:

    sed 's/.*var=\x27\([^\x27]*\)\x27.*/\1/'

to extract "some string" from "var='some string'". Or if you don't know
about the quoting, but know there are quotes

    sed 's/.*var=.\([^"\x27]*\)..*/\1/'

### Conditional Replace with sed

    sed '/conditional pattern/{s/pattern/replacement/g}'

### Prefix files with a boilerplate using sed

    sed -i '1s/^/# DO NOT TOUCH THIS FILE!\n\n/' *

### Replacing Newlines with sed

The only way to replace newline characters is this:

    sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n//g' file

Check out [this explanation](/Removing-newlines-with-sed) if you want to
know why. With GNU sed you might also want to try the `-z` option:

    sed -z "s/\n//g"
    
Note that the `-z` option line splits on `\0`, so this relies on the input
text file not containing any `\0` which usually should be sufficient.

### Selecting Blocks

    sed '/first line/,/last line/!d' file
    
### Capitalize word

    sed -e "s/\b\(.\)/\u\1/g"
