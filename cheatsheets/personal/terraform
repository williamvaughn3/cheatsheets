## CLI Commands

    terraform plan         # dry run
    terraform apply
    terraform apply -input=false -auto-approve tfplan           # applying previously create plan
    
    terraform refresh      # sync state with remote resources
    terraform show
    terraform destroy
    
    terraform validate     # validate .tf file
    
    terraform taint        # mark resource for recreation
    terraform untaint
    
    terraform state push   # e.g. force push state to S3 bucket
    terraform state pull > terraform.tfstate  # create a local state copy
    
    terraform force-unlock <lock-id-guid>     # Clean up leftover locks from hard-cancelled run
    
Change verbosity by setting environment variable TF_LOG

    export TF_LOG=INFO

For linting

     terraform fmt <file>           # reformat .tf file
     terraform fmt --check <file>   # check for correct formatting
     
## Configuration via Environment

While most of the configuration should reside in .tfvars files you might want to inject 
some config values from environment like this:

     export TF_VAR_<my variable>=<my value>
     
## Workspace Management 

Terraform workspaces allow for the management of two or more different environments i.e. Dev or Prod separately without affecting the state of either environment.
    
    terraform workspace new dev   
    terraform workspace new test
    terraform workspace new prod
    terraform workspace select dev
    terraform workspace select default  
    terraform workspace select prod

## Recovering Lost State

One of the worst things that you happen is [loosing the terraform state](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/93cee5/if_you_lost_your_terraform_state_you_will_lose/). In such a case you can

    terraform import <address> <id>
    
    # for example
    terraform import aws_instance.myec2instance i-075c8d21cc91308dc

    
to let terraform reconstruct the resource state. Finally perform a

    terraform state push

as import only imports into a local state file, even if you have an S3 bucket defined for keeping state!

To avoid this use S3 bucket with versioning enabled for keeping state.

## Drift Management

Terraform [doesn't really do](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/detecting-and-managing-drift-with-terraform)
much drift management. Only some resource attributes are checked. All detected drift is fixed by "apply".

Manually dump drift

    terraform show >before
    terraform refresh
    terraform show >after
   
    diff -u before after
 
Prevent auto-destroy:

     lifecycle {
        prevent_destroy = true
     }

## Remote Exec

    provisioner "remote-exec" {
        inline = [
             "apt-get -y install wget",
             "wget https://example.com/something"
        ]
    }

## Heredoc

    resource "aws_iam_policy" "mypolicy" {
       name = "mypolicy"
       policy = <<EOF
    {
        "Version": "2020-07-01",
        "Statement": ...
    }
    EOF
    }
    
## Foreach

To create multiple resources use this construct

    locals {
      settings = {
        "key1"  = { prop1 = "xxx", prop2 = false },
        "key2"   = { prop1 = "yyy", prop2 = true },
        [...]
      }
    }

    resource "myresourcetype" "map" {
      for_each      = local.settings

      name          = each.key
      prop1         = each.value.prop1
      prop2         = each.value.prop2
      prop3         = "some constant"
    }
