## Nautilus on !FritzBox NAS

Due to buggy Nautilus (last tested with GNOME 42) only the following works:

1. Install samba-common package to get default `/etc/samba/smb.conf`
2. In `/etc/samba/smb.conf` under `[global]` add 

       client min protocol = NT1

**Important: THIS IS VERY INSECURE!** This configures your system to use the insecure 
and legacy SMBv1 protocol.

Consider alternative using a more secure CIFS mount in `/etc/fstab` like this

     //192.168.178.1/fritz.nas /mnt/fritzbox cifs credentials=/home/<user>/.credentials,uid=1000,gid=1000
