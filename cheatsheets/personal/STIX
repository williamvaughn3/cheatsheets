TAXII (Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information) is a protocol used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI) over HTTPS

STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) is a language used to represent standardized CTI. 

### STIX Basics

STIX JSON Example:
{
  "type": "indicator",
  "spec_version": "2.1",
  "id": "indicator--a932fcc6-e053-467b-bf12-66613b3f9f86",
  "created": "2022-01-01T12:34:56.789Z",
  "modified": "2022-01-01T12:34:56.789Z",
  "name": "Malicious IP",
  "pattern": "[ipv4-addr:value = '10.0.0.1']",
  "pattern_type": "stix"
}

# YAML to JSON is easy, and YAML is more readable.  Highly rec. using jq / yq tools.

### TAXII Basics

Endpoints:
	Discovery Endpoint: Provides information about the services available on a TAXII server.
	API Root Endpoint: Lists available collections and provides general server information.
	Collection Endpoint: Provides details about and access to a specific collection.
	Status Endpoint: Retrieves the status of a request.

### Common Utilities

- cti-taxii-client: A Python client for querying TAXII servers.
  # List available collections:
  taxii2-client --url https://taxii.server/api/ --collections

  # Fetch STIX objects from a collection:
  taxii2-client --url https://taxii.server/api/ --collection <COLLECTION_ID> --fetch
  
- pycti: OpenCTI Python connector for interacting with the OpenCTI platform and TAXII servers.
  
  from pycti import OpenCTIApiClient
  
  # Connect to OpenCTI
  api_client = OpenCTIApiClient(url, token)
  
  # List TAXII collections
  api_client.taxii.collection.list()
  
  # Fetch STIX objects from a TAXII collection
  api_client.taxii.collection.fetch(collection_id)
  
### STIX Visualization and Tools

MISP: Malware Information Sharing Platform can ingest and produce STIX formatted content.
OpenCTI: An open-source platform that integrates with TAXII servers and provides visualization for STIX data.
TAXII Server: A server implementation for hosting and distributing STIX datasets.

### Best Practices

1. Data Validation: Always validate the STIX content you're receiving.
2. Regular Updates: Keep your threat intelligence updated by polling TAXII feeds at regular intervals.
3. Enrichment: Combine STIX feeds with other intelligence sources for better context.
4. Data Storage: Store STIX data in a database for faster access and better performance.
5. Data Visualization: Use a visualization tool to better understand the STIX data you're receiving.
6. Data Sharing: Share your STIX data with other organizations to improve the overall security posture.
7. Data Analysis: Use a tool like OpenCTI to analyze the STIX data you're receiving.
8. Data Correlation: Correlate STIX data with other data sources to identify patterns and trends.
9. Data Enrichment: Enrich STIX data with other data sources to improve the overall quality of the data.
10. Data Aggregation: Aggregate STIX data from multiple sources to get a better picture of the threat landscape.
