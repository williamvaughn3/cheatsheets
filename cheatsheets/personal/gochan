<h3>Creating Go Channels</h3>

Channels in Golang are like Unix pipes. Create channels using 'make()' and the 'chan' keyword by passing the data type

<pre>my_pipe := make(chan string)</pre>

<h3>Reading from Go Channels</h3>

To read from a Go channel use the "&lt;-" operator

<pre>value := <-my_pipe</pre>

<h3>Writing to Go Channels</h3>

You can write to Go Channels using the same "&lt;-" operator. 

<pre>my_pipe <- "1000"</pre>

<h3>Don't write on closed channels</h3>

When you write on a closed channels you will trigger an error!
